# SyscallTest 
    
    I am curious about the api, the operating system provide for programmers.

    This repo is just for someone who want learn syscall, 

    I will provide enough test sample for learn.

## before start
    
    I just only print errno, rather than the err message, you can check with man page to know 
    
    what it is.
